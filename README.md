In this assignment, i've used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of my choice. To finish this task, i had to call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.

   * Like many APIs, GIPHY requires developers to use a key to access their API data. To use the GIPHY API, i've created a GIPHY account  and then obtained an API Key by [creating an app](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true).

   * I've chosen  animals for my theme, created an array of it and then stored it in a variable called "topics".

   * My app takes the topics in this array and creates buttons in the HTML.
   * Using a loop it appends a button for each string in the array.

   * When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place        them on the page.

   * When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should        stop playing.

   * Under every gif, there is  its rating (PG, G, so on).
   * This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
   * Only once you get images displaying with button presses should you move on to the next step.
